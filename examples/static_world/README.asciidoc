= Static file handler example

To try this example, you need GNU `make` and `git` in your PATH.

To build and run the example, use the following command:

[source,bash]
$ make run

The example will serve all the files found in the 'priv/'
directory. For example:

* http://localhost:8080/test.txt[Plain text file]
* http://localhost:8080/video.html[HTML5 video demo]

== Example output

[source,bash]

$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/test.txt
