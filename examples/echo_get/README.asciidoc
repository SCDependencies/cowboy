= GET parameter echo example

To try this example, you need GNU `make` and `git` in your PATH.

To build and run the example, use the following command:

[source,bash]
$ make run

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8080/?echo=hello

You can replace the `echo` parameter with another to check
that the handler is echoing it back properly.

== Example output

[source,bash]
