= Hello world example

To try this example, you need GNU `make` and `git` in your PATH.

To build and run the example, use the following command:

[source,bash]
$ make run

Then point your browser to https://localhost:8443

You will need to temporarily trust the root certificate authority,
which can also be found in `priv/ssl/cowboy-ca.crt`.

== Example output
