= POST parameter echo example

To try this example, you need GNU `make` and `git` in your PATH.

To build and run the example, use the following command:

[source,bash]
$ make run

As this example echoes a POST parameter, it is a little more
complex to test. Some browsers feature tools that allow you
to perform one such request, or you can use the command line
tool `curl` as we will demonstrate.

== Example output
